### This is an all too real story. Online games are just like this, after all.
### Sunset was an online game similar to Fantasy Westward Journey, a game that ruined countless people's life trajectories in the real world.
### Fei Fei Lu and Deng Huo Lan Shan were both lost in this virtual world.
### One was an internet cafe administrator who dropped out of school because of social ostracism, and the other was a student at a prestigious university whose life was altered because of an online game.
### When Fei Fei Lu met Deng Huo Lan Shan, their philosophies collided. Each changed the other, but neither could ultimately hide from the cruelty of reality.
### In the end, was it people that played games or games that played with human nature?
